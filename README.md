## 👋 Hi, I'm Yao!

🐴 I am actively seeking job opportunities in Software Engineer (Frontend, Backend, Fullstack) and related fields!

🎓 I graduated from Stony Brook University at May 2025 with a 💻Computer Science Degree. 

🌱 I’m currently learning new frontend frameworks and techniques.

🤔 I’m actively building new projects, perhaps with SQL based storage and maybe with AI features.
